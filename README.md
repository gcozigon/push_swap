# push_swap

Push Swap is a sorting algorithm project designed to enhance my understanding of algorithmic complexity, sorting algorithms, and stack manipulation. 

The goal of the project is to sort a list of integers using only two stacks and a limited set of operations. 

This challenge required me to implement efficient sorting solutions, optimizing both the number of moves and the overall complexity
